1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Ans : Blockchain is a distributed database existing on multiple computers at the same time. It is constantly growing as new sets of recordings, or 'blocks', are added to it.
Each block contains a timestamp and a link to the previous block, so they actually form a chain.

2. What is the core problem, Blockchain trying to solve?
Ans : Blockchains offer an immutable ledger of data without relying on a central authorityâ€”that's core to the hype behind the technology.
But the cryptographic machinery behind blockchains is notoriously slow.They retain central entities that control the data, doing away with the central innovation of blockchains.

3. What are the features of Blockchain?
Ans : Cannot be Corrupted
      Decentralized Technology
      Enhanced Security
      Irreversible
      Distributed Ledgers
      Consensus
      Faster Settlement
      
 4. What does a Block contain?
 Ans : The transactions executed during a given period of time are recorded into a file called a block, which is the basis of the blockchain network.
 A block represents the 'present' and contains information about its past and future.
 
 5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been achieved?
 Ans : As public ledgers, Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum require transactions to be visible by default.
